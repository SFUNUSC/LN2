LN2 SERVER PARAMETERS
New parameters will be applied whenever the LN2_server program is restarted.

sensor_threshold_V[5]                    ## Sensor threshold (in volts) that indicates an LN2 overflow.
scale_threshold_kg[185]                  ## Scale reading (in kg) below which the user is warned that tank is close to empty.
sensor_reading_interval_ms[10000]        ## Time in ms between sensor readings when not filling (more than 2000 milliseconds)
readings_before_fill_stop[12]            ## Integer number of measurements allowed above the sensor threshold before stopping LN2 flow.
max_filling_time[1500]                   ## Maximum length of time during which filling can take place before automatic shut-off of valves.
buffer_size[1000]                        ## Size of the data saving buffers (# of data points).
autosave[1]                              ## Boolean (0=false, 1=true) determining if data will be automatically saved and uploaded after every fill.
upload_loc[/home/jono/]   ## Network OR local location to upload to (username@hostname:location).
send_email[0]                            ## Boolean (0=false, 1=true) telling program whether it should send alerts by e-mail.
email_adress[fake_email]                 ## E-mail address to send alerts to.

If autosave is enabled, the program will wait until 15% of the filling interval has passed after a fill before saving data.
This lets each plot show the behaviour of the system after the fill is completed.
