RUN PARAMETER DATAFILE
This tells the server what run parameters to use.
Don't modify the line spacing of this file, or the server program will crash on startup.
New parameters will be applied whenever the server program is restarted.

First day of week for fill (0-6, sunday = 0):
1
Second day of week for fill (0-6, sunday = 0):
4
Hour of the day to start fill (0-24):
11
Minute of the above hour of the day to start fill (0-59):
30
Sensor threshold (in volts) that indicates an LN2 overflow:
5
Scale reading (in kg) below which the user is warned that tank is close to empty.
185
Integer amount of time between sensor readings when filling (more than 2000 milliseconds):
5000
Integer multiple of above time that determines frequency of sensor readings between fillings:
12
Integer number of measurements allowed above the sensor threshold before stopping LN2 flow:
12
Maximum length of time during which filling can take place before automatic shut-off of valves (s):
1500
Size of the data saving buffers (# of data points):
1000
Boolean (0=false, 1=true) determining if data will be automatically saved and uploaded after every fill:
1
Network OR local location to upload to (username@hostname:location):
/home/LN2/public_html/LN2/
Boolean (0=false, 1=true) telling program whether it should send alerts by e-mail:
1
E-mail address to send alerts to:
fake_email@sfu.ca


If autosave is enabled, the program will wait until 15% of the filling interval has passed after a fill before saving data.
This lets each plot show the behaviour of the system after the fill is completed.
